## Problems of ESM

As I started project, I have misconception of two environments.
One of them is [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/), and other one is [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/).

## Electron

Electron is cross-platform desktop application framework.

Node.js backend(main) process runs Chromium, and user will interact with webpage(renderer).
System functionalities such as file access or accessing environment variables are accomplished by main process.
As Chromium runs well in all major OS, Electron apps also run well in all major OS.

And problem with Electron is, it does [not support ESM](https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/21457).
There are 3rd party libraries for Electron ESM, but are not maintained well.

So I found it will be hard time to configure Electron to work with ESM.

## React Native

React Native is cross-platform mobile application framework.

It renders React components to native platform UI.
And there comes problem-**Components are not shared with React.js**.

As I work to build shared UI library for this project, I found this fact, and get in stuck.

`Learn once, write anyware. - React Native`

Yes, React Native may run in everywhere, but React not.

## Summary

As from February on I have very busy time at work. So I have very little time for ESM project research.

I may continue this project when I have more time to research or more environments support ESM well.

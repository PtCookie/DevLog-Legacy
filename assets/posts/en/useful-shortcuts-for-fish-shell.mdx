## Fish shell

Fish shell is friendly interactive shell.
It has many great features, like autosuggestions, syntax highlighting, web based configuration, etc.

It also has some useful key bindings. Let's look for some of those.

## Move to previous / next directory

- `prevd`: `Alt` + `Left`
- `nextd`: `Alt` + `Right`

```shell
$ pwd # $HOME

$ cd Downloads # pwd: $HOME/Downloads/

$ prevd # pwd: $HOME

$ nextd # pwd: $HOME/Downloads/
```

## List directory contents

- Run `ls`: `Alt` + `L`

> if `ls` is alias for something, that alias will be used.

```shell
$ SOME_DIRECTORY/ # press `Alt` + `L` to list contents of SOME_DIRECTORY
```

## Using pager

- Append `&| less`: `Alt` + `P`
- Open with pager: `Alt` + `O`

```shell
$ cat SOME_LARGE_TEXT # press `Alt` + `P`
$ cat SOME_LARGE_TEXT &| less

$ SOME_LARGE_TEXT # press `Alt` + `O` to open with pager
```

## Need help

- Open manual page: `Alt` + `H` or `F1`
- Short description: `Alt` + `W`

```shell
$ cat # press `Alt` + `H` or `F1` to show manpage

$ cat # press `Alt` + `W` to show description
```

## Edit command with external editor

- Open `$VISUAL` or `$EDITOR`: `Alt` + `E` or `Alt` + `V`

```shell
$ SOME VERY_LONG COMMAND WITH_ARGS # press `Alt` + `E` or `Alt` + `V` to edit

$ SOME \
  VERY_LONG \
  COMMAND \
  WITH_ARGS # After edit
```

## Run previous command with `sudo`

- Run previous command with `sudo`: `Alt` + `S`

```shell
$ vim /etc/shells # cannot edit without privilege

$ sudo vim /etc/shells # press `Alt` + `S` to autocomplete
```

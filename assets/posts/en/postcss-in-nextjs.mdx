## PostCSS, A tool for transforming CSS with JavaScript

[PostCSS](https://postcss.org/) is CSS preprocessor.
It handles styles with javascript plugins.

I know there have been CSS preprocessors' exist, such as [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/), [Less](https://lesscss.org/),
but as they have their own syntax, I prefer not use them.

And there comes PostCSS.

As its name indicates, PostCSS support future CSS, which may be adopted in the future.
As it has not very different syntax to standard CSS, I'll take a look at it.

## PostCSS Plugin

While studying PostCSS, first thing I learned is that PostCSS has no feature,
but plugins have features to be added.

Future CSS is the feature of [PostCSS Preset Env](https://preset-env.cssdb.org/),
prepending vendor prefixes such as -webkit, -moz is the feature of [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer).

There are other plugins, [PostCSS Nested](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-nested) support nesting like Sass,
linting support from [stylelint](https://stylelint.io/), make it able to use other preprocessors like Sass or Less.

## PostCSS in NextJS

Next.js has built-in PostCSS support.
Default behavior of PostCSS in Next.js looks like this.

```javascript
// postcss.config.js

module.exports = {
  plugins: {
    'postcss-flexbugs-fixes': {},
    'postcss-preset-env': {
      autoprefixer: {
        flexbox: 'no-2009',
      },
      stage: 3,
      features: {
        'custom-properties': false,
      },
    },
  },
};
```

Active plugins

- [PostCSS Flexbugs Fixes](https://github.com/luisrudge/postcss-flexbugs-fixes)
  Fix bugs related to flex property.
- [PostCSS Preset Env](https://preset-env.cssdb.org/)
  Enable to use future CSS.

Applied properties of PostCSS Preset Env

- **autoprefixer** flexbox no-2009 : Prepend vendor prefix for flexbox(> IE 10).

- **stage** 3 : Support polyfill for Stage 3(Candidate) syntax.

- **custom properties** false : Disable custom properties.

```css
img {
  --some-length: 32px;

  height: var(--some-length);
  width: var(--some-length);
}
```

Disable feature likes --some-length above.

## Customize PostCSS in NextJS

Default behavior may be enough, but let's add some features.
According to Next.js docs, if PostCSS config file exists, default behavior of Next.js is ignored.
So let's copy default configuration, and add those npm packages.

```shell
$ npm install postcss postcss-flexbugs-fixes postcss-preset-env
```

Add more PostCSS plugins, such as apply PostCSS in styled-jsx.

```shell
$ npm install postcss-import styled-jsx-plugin-postcss
```

- [postcss-import](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-import)
  Merge `@import`ed style files into one file.
- [styled-jsx-plugin-postcss](https://github.com/giuseppeg/styled-jsx-plugin-postcss)
  Enable PostCSS in styled-jsx.

After installation finished, let's make config file.

```javascript
// postcss.config.js

module.exports = {
  plugins: {
    'postcss-import': {},
    'postcss-flexbugs-fixes': {},
    'postcss-preset-env': {
      autoprefixer: {
        flexbox: 'no-2009',
      },
      stage: 3,
      features: {
        'custom-properties': false,
        'nesting-rules': true,
      },
    },
  },
};
```

During configuration I found PostCSS' weird behavior, it loads plugins in order as is written in configuration file.
So plugin sorting is very important, and should check the plugin's document.

As document of postcss-import says it should be used as first plugin so that other plugins can process single file,
so put postcss-import first and Next.js default config next. And enable CSS nesting, most interesting part of Sass.

Applying plugin to styled-jsx needs babel config. Let's make one following document.

```javascript
// babel.config.js

module.exports = {
  presets: [
    [
      'next/babel',
      {
        'styled-jsx': {
          plugins: ['styled-jsx-plugin-postcss'],
        },
      },
    ],
  ],
};
```

Check whether plugins applied after configuration finished.

```css
a {
  color: #9b9b9b;
  text-decoration: none;
  transition: color 0.3s ease;

  &:active,
  &:hover {
    color: #000;
  }
}
```

```tsx
<style jsx>
  {`
    ...
    .active {
      color: #222;
      & ul {
        opacity: 1;
        transform: translateY(0);
      }
    }
    ...
  `}
</style>
```

It works with no problem.
